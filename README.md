Image Classifier App

This Streamlit app is an Image Classifier that uses a pre-trained neural network model to classify uploaded images into various categories. The app provides a user-friendly interface for users to upload an image, and the model predicts the class of the image along with the corresponding accuracy.
Features

    Upload Image: Users can upload an image from their device.
    Image Classification: The app uses a pre-trained neural network model to classify images into categories.
